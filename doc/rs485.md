# The protocol over RS485 line

## Hardware Level

Analyzing the signal with an oscilloscope shown +12v and -12v pulses, which hinted that the signal may be regular RS485. That was confirmed later when connected Saleae logic analyzer. More detailed look into the timing of logic signals suggested the following parameters of the signal encoding:

* Speed 19200 bod
* 8 bit data frames
* 1 stop bit
* No parity

This was later confirmed in reverse engineering the firmware with Ghidra.

## Protocol

THe protocol is pretty simple in that there is no time coordination between requests and responses. Rather both sides, the remote control device and the heater just send packates over "their direction" of rs485. In other words, the communication is full duplex with two sides sending packets as they are ready.



## Packet Format

All packets, in both directions have a common overall format consisting of header, data part and a control sum.

Packets always start with a byte value 0xF7, which serves as a marker of starting the frame (also confirmed in reversed code).

| &nbsp; &nbsp; Header &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Data &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp;  Checksum &nbsp; &nbsp;  |
|--------|------|----------|

#### Example

| | |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
|Header|F7 05 50 50 90 22 | 
|Data | 42 00 00 25 49 5C 5B 53 00 00 00 00 00 00 88 C2 00 20 02 00 00 00 21 03 99 08 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 |
|Checksum| 87 |



### Header

Only some of the values in the header are reversed at this point in time. The table below shows reversed values and their respective meaning:

| Offset | Purpose / Meaning |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 0xF7 - fixed value. Marks the start of frame | 
| 0x01   | Observed to be always 0x05. However in the code there are references to 0x05 and 0x01 as well a a check for value to be in [1..9] range. |
| 0x02   | Likely packet or protocol type/version. Observed to be always 0x50. The logic in reversed code uses this to determine the seed constant for CRC calculation. If 0x50 - seed is 0x4B else 0x62|
| 0x03   | |
| 0x04   | |
| 0x05   | Data length in bytes = packet length - header length - 1 byte for the checksum |

#### Example
| | |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
|0xF7| Packet start marker |
|0x05| Unknown, always 0x05
|0x50| Packet type/version
|0x50|
|0x90|
|0x22| Length, 34 bytes
|42 00 00 25 14 5F 4C 4C 00 00 00 00 00 00 88 C2 00 20 02 00 00 00 21 03 9A 08 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00| Data| 
|0xD8| Checksum
