# The protocol over RS485 line

## Hardware Level

Analyzing the signal with an oscilloscope shown +12v and -12v pulses, which hinted that the signal may be regular RS485. That was confirmed later when connected Saleae logic analyzer. More detailed look into the timing of logic signals suggested the following parameters of the signal encoding:

* Speed 19200 bod
* 8 bit data frames
* 1 stop bit
* No parity

This was later confirmed in reverse engineering the firmware with Ghidra.
